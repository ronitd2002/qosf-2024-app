# Noise model simulation.

The main circuit is that of Quantum arithmetic implemented via QFT using Draper addition method. The purpose of this task is to show the effect of noise effects like bit flip and phase flip errors via a pauli operator set explicitly. The biggest challenge is to build the transpiler/ decomposer from scratch.
